I get restless with working with one type of material so I often jump between several like metal, fabric, thread, glass, and resin. Each technique also helps me expend energy, or practice focus and patience. For example, shaping metal by hammering, twisting and heating relieves stress from the work day. Micro macramé with its rhythm and detail works my brain differently in a meditative manner. Most of my pieces connect to nature. I have always been drawn to flowers, leaves, natural and organic shapes. Necklaces that have leaf shaped pendants, or items that contain gemstones in their rustic organic shapes. Some of my designs even have flower petals set in resin.<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div class=\\"bottom-text-pad\\" style=\\"height: 1em; font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div></div></div>","style":{"fontFamily":"Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"normal"}},"media":{"image":{"assetId":10,"posterAltText":"kelly p attempt 1.png"}},"button":null}}},{"id":"5bbdfd0dbf8d48cdaab72decdf8d1305","xPos":-733.9787,"yPos":-34.4440422,"zPos":-609.563,"props":{"name":"\\"WHY?\\" - Toni Woolfork-Barnes, Ed.D - Director, Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, WMUX","type":"normal","iconSource":{"assetId":2},"fgColor":"#FFFFFF","bgColor":"#019081","scaleX":94.28484,"scaleY":94.28484,"iconScale":0.6,"hasPanel":true,"hasTooltip":false,"hasLabel":false,"hasHotspotHint":false,"untracked":false,"boxShadow":"0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)","panel":{"hasArrow":true,"borderRadius":5,"maxWidth":260,"boxShadow":"0 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)","textColor":"#FFFFFF","fill":"#212121","stroke":"transparent","strokeWidth":0,"mediaAccent":null,"title":{"innerHTML":"\\"WHY?\\" -&nbsp;<span style=\\"font-weight: normal; font-family: \'MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51\';\\">Toni Woolfork-Barnes, Ed.D - Director, Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, WMUX</span>","style":{"fontFamily":"MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"bold"}},"body":{"innerHTML":"<span style=\\"font-style: italic; font-family: \'MontserratItalic Italic95E6C22E\';\\"></span>When people hear the words diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) their responses are varied. For me, at the heart of all the work around DEI, is the word humanity. Humanity is at the core, the very essence of how we see and treat one another. As a novice artist, I was motivated to write a poem to capture a range of emotions precipitated by injustice and disregard for humanity and the disregard for life. My artwork tries to speak to inequities of how Black Men are targeted because of the pigment of their skin, for which they have no choice. It speaks to the senseless loss of life and dreams particularly for generations of Black Men and Black Boys never to have been realized. This piece serves to globally ask the pivotal question – why are things different for my sons in comparison to your sons? This project combines the written word and visual images that may invoke the viewer to also ponder the question WHY? \\n<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div class=\\"bottom-text-pad\\" style=\\"height: 1em; font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div></div></div>","style":{"fontFamily":"Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"normal"}},"media":{"image":{"assetId":13,"posterAltText":"toni 2.png"}},"button":null}}},{"id":"ab7ee10535be4532882e5815a5ce7311","xPos":-741.927246,"yPos":17.053627,"zPos":570.767151,"props":{"name":"\\"This is Me\\" - Alyssa Moon - Lead Instructional Designer, WMUx","type":"normal","iconSource":{"assetId":2},"fgColor":"#FFFFFF","bgColor":"#019081","scaleX":93.88506,"scaleY":93.88506,"iconScale":0.6,"hasPanel":true,"hasTooltip":false,"hasLabel":false,"hasHotspotHint":false,"untracked":false,"boxShadow":"0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)","panel":{"hasArrow":true,"borderRadius":5,"maxWidth":260,"boxShadow":"0 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)","textColor":"#FFFFFF","fill":"#212121","stroke":"transparent","strokeWidth":0,"mediaAccent":null,"title":{"innerHTML":"\\"This is Me\\" - <span style=\\"font-weight: normal; font-family: \'MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51\';\\">Alyssa Moon - Lead Instructional Designer, WMUx </span>","style":{"fontFamily":"MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"bold"}},"body":{"innerHTML":"<span style=\\"font-style: italic; font-family: \'MontserratItalic Italic95E6C22E\';\\"></span>Who I am is a compilation of all who have come before me, the events that I have experienced, the world in which I live and the society and ideas and experiences that have come before.

In putting together this project I was overwhelmed by the intense privilege I have in that I have these photos, lovingly gathered and researched by family, and some of the stories of those who came before. I know where I come from. I am humbled and grateful for that. I have always been someone who makes things. I use whatever I have available, and I often change course mid-project because I have a new idea or things are not going according to plan.
