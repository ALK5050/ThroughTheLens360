In putting together this project I was overwhelmed by the intense privilege I have in that I have these photos, lovingly gathered and researched by family, and some of the stories of those who came before. I know where I come from. I am humbled and grateful for that. I have always been someone who makes things. I use whatever I have available, and I often change course mid-project because I have a new idea or things are not going according to plan.

For me, at the heart of all the work around DEI, is the word humanity. Humanity is at the core, the very essence of how we see and treat one another. As a novice artist, I was motivated to write a poem to capture a range of emotions precipitated by injustice and disregard for humanity and the disregard for life. My artwork tries to speak to inequities of how Black Men are targeted because of the pigment of their skin, for which they have no choice. It speaks to the senseless loss of life and dreams particularly for generations of Black Men and Black Boys never to have been realized. This piece serves to globally ask the pivotal question – why are things different for my sons in comparison to your sons?

Spending time “looking down” allows me to both see the “greater picture” and understand the “whys” of the world. While flying, I see the ways in which forests and cities relate to each other. I find understanding in those who don’t strive for understanding in each other. As my drones hover, they peer silently into the everyday lives of others, slowly drifting away, almost as if never to ever exist to begin with; a simple feeling I find myself occasionally envious of. \\n \\n<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div class=\\"bottom-text-pad\\" style=\\"height: 1em; font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div></div></div>","style":{"fontFamily":"Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"normal"}},"media":{"image":{"assetId":21,"posterAltText":"bracey 1.png"}},"button":null}}},{"id":"d57aa505473241c0a2c542f9bf2370cc","xPos":209.432266,"yPos":-2.721686,"zPos":927.0504,"props":{"name":"\\"To everything there is a season...\\" - Tammy Morgan - Director of Student Engagement, WMUx","type":"normal","iconSource":{"assetId":2},"fgColor":"#FFFFFF","bgColor":"#019081","scaleX":113.146622,"scaleY":113.146622,"iconScale":0.6,"hasPanel":true,"hasTooltip":false,"hasLabel":false,"hasHotspotHint":false,"untracked":false,"boxShadow":"0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)","panel":{"hasArrow":true,"borderRadius":5,"maxWidth":260,"boxShadow":"0 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)","textColor":"#FFFFFF","fill":"#212121","stroke":"transparent","strokeWidth":0,"mediaAccent":null,"title":{"innerHTML":"\\"To everything there is a season...\\" - <span style=\\"font-weight: normal; font-family: \'MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51\';\\">Tammy Morgan - Director of Student Engagement, WMUx </span>","style":{"fontFamily":"MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"bold"}},"body":{"innerHTML":"<span style=\\"font-style: italic; font-family: \'MontserratItalic Italic95E6C22E\';\\"></span>In preparing for the Through the Lens project, one of the goals was to show you a little bit more about us personally and how we feel our piece relates to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.&nbsp;<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><br style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\">We live in Michigan and embrace each season together.

That is not the full picture though, which is where I thought of the hidden spectacle.&nbsp;<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><br style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\">The hidden spectacle is two parts: the system which oppresses and creates dogs who lash out and the system of using our privileges (whether that be money, culture, or race/ethnicity) to create a system that cultivates and utilizes the strengths of diversity. It is true that bully breeds have attacked people and people are most likely to suffer a severe injury from these encounters. Yet, it is also true that bullies are the most abused dog breed and have some of the best temperaments among all dogs, which is why they were known as great family dogs.&nbsp;</div><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><br style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\">I have the privilege of owning a stinky yet loving bully of my own, but systemically these dog types are difficult to own. Historically many of our homeless population, low-income families, and/or minority families have owned Pitbull breeds. These are people who could only afford renting for housing, but most apartment complexes in Kalamazoo have banned bully type dogs. It does beg the question of whether it is a dog ban or gentrification. When we do not nurture an environment of inclusivity, we are systemically blinding the minority and telling them to find the finish line. All in all, there is no comparison to the feeling of coming home and being greeted by my furball dog’s smile and wagging his entire body with joy, free of judgement; that is the spectacle I hope to portray in this piece. <div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"> \\n<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div class=\\"bottom-text-pad\\" style=\\"height: 1em; font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div></div></div></div></div></div>","style":{"fontFamily":"Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"normal"}},"media":{"image":{"assetId":26,"posterAltText":"20220519_135731.png"}},"button":null}}},{"id":"97c4655979bd46a583c61a0ce18b20f5","xPos":-408.834442,"yPos":-8.773181,"zPos":-876.0846,"props":{"name":"\\"The Once Whites of Women\'s Eyes\\" - Michelle Ringle-Barrett (she/her/hers) - ’03, ’09, English Education | Doctoral Candidate, Poetry - Manager, Bronco Study Zone, Student Success Services, Merze Tate College","type":"normal","iconSource":{"assetId":2},"fgColor":"#FFFFFF","bgColor":"#019081","scaleX":117.33149,"scaleY":117.33149,"iconScale":0.6,"hasPanel":true,"hasTooltip":false,"hasLabel":false,"hasHotspotHint":false,"untracked":false,"boxShadow":"0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)","panel":{"hasArrow":true,"borderRadius":5,"maxWidth":260,"boxShadow":"0 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)","textColor":"#FFFFFF","fill":"#212121","stroke":"transparent","strokeWidth":0,"mediaAccent":null,"title":{"innerHTML":"\\"The Once Whites of Women\'s Eyes\\" -&nbsp;<span style=\\"font-weight: normal; font-family: \'MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51\';\\">Michelle Ringle-Barrett (she/her/hers) - ’03, ’09, English Education | Doctoral Candidate, Poetry - Manager, Bronco Study Zone, Student Success Services, Merze Tate College </span>","style":{"fontFamily":"MontserratBold CharBoldE28D0D51","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"bold"}},"body":{"innerHTML":"<span style=\\"font-style: italic; font-family: \'MontserratItalic Italic95E6C22E\';\\"></span>This collection of poetry explores the deep inner life of feminine ways of knowing. This means knowing the world through, nature, experience, intuition, emotion and deep, raw feeling; sometimes there is only feeling. As a cis-gender white woman, I aim to explore the identity ‘Woman’ and its transformation since the addition of the special misogyny and invisibleness reserved for ‘Mother’. I aim to give voice to those hidden in the shadows through an anti-racist feminist lens.\\n<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"> \\n<div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div style=\\"font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"><div class=\\"bottom-text-pad\\" style=\\"height: 1em; font-family: \'Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779\';\\"></div></div></div></div></div>","style":{"fontFamily":"Montserrat Charset0_v9p2ADCB779","fontThemeType":"none","fontSize":12.0,"fontWeight":"normal"}},"media":{"image":{"assetId":27,"posterAltText":"20220519_135823.jpg"}},"button":null}}},{"id":"31fb511454294c0abbbee8aafafd8906","xPos":889.170654,"yPos":-266.8184,"zPos":189.79718,"props":{"name":"Marker 1","type":"normal","iconSource":{"assetId":4},"fgColor":"#FFFFFF","bgColor":"#BFBFBF","scaleX":146.328278,"scaleY":146.328278,"iconScale":0.6,"hasPanel":false,"hasTooltip":false,"hasLabel":false,"hasHotspotHint":false,"untracked":false,"boxShadow":"0 0 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)"}}]},"width":720,"height":540,"resume":true,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6jppoIMf8a1","events":[{"kind":"onlinkrelease","triggerid":"31fb511454294c0abbbee8aafafd8906","actions":[{"kind":"gotoplay","window":"_current","wndtype":"normal","objRef":{"type":"string","value":"_player.6HnYI7pSGt8.6q1XamqH7mN"}}]}]}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":true,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}');
